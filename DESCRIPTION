Description: We provide a stage-wise selection method using genetic algorithms, designed to efficiently identify main and two-way interactions within high-dimensional linear regression models. Additionally, it implements simulated annealing algorithm during the mutation process. The relevant paper can be found at: Ye, C.,and Yang,Y. (2019) <doi:10.1109/TIT.2019.2913417>.
